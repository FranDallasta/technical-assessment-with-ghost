# Delete an employee's record

### Introduction

The `/delete/{id}` API allows you to delete a specific employee record by its ID. 

ðŸ’¡ Before you delete any record, it is recomended to check the employee's id first. Use this [request](/API_Documentation/employeeById.mdx) for that. 

### Prerequisites

- An API testing tool like **Postman** on your system.
- Basic understanding of how to import a cURL into your API testing tool.

### Delete an employee's record: 

To delete an employee record, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash

curl --location --request DELETE 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/delete/2'

```

This is the standard response that you will receive after running that command: 

```bash

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": "2",
    "message": "Successfully! Record has been deleted"
}

```
