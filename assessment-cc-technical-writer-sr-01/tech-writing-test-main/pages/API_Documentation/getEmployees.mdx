# GET all the employees

### Introduction 

The `/employee` API allows you to list all employees data.  This guide will help you understand how to use the GET feature to retrieve that information.

### Prerequisites

- An API testing tool like **Postman** on your system.
- Basic understanding of how to import a cURL into your API testing tool.

### Retrieve Employee Data

Use the following cURL command to retrieve the list of employees:

```bash

    curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees'

```

This is the standard response that you will receive after running that command: 

```bash

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "employee_name": "Tiger Nixon",
            "employee_salary": 320800,
            "employee_age": 61,
            "profile_image": ""
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "employee_name": "Garrett Winters",
            "employee_salary": 170750,
            "employee_age": 63,
            "profile_image": ""
        },
        {...},
    ],
    "message": "Successfully! All records has been fetched."
}

```
