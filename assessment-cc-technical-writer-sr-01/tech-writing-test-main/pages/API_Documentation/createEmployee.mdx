# POST new employee 

This operation is used to create a new employee. To use it, paste this cURL command into your API tester:

```bash

    curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "name": "Iroh",
        "salary": "3500",
        "age": "63"
    }'

```

This is the standard response for a Successful HTTP request: 

```bash

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "name": "Iroh",
            "salary": "3500",
            "age": "63",
            "id": 4908
        },
        "message": "Successfully! Record has been added."
    }
